# Python-Finance-Algorithmic-Trading


These are projects which I created while learning to use Python for Financial analysis and Algo trading. 

The resources used for learning are Sentdex's website - pythonprogramming.net, as well as his youtube tutorials for machine learning,
and Quantopian (quantopian.com) which has many algo trading strategies and tutorials.
